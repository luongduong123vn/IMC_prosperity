predict where price is moving simply by looking at mm volumes
look at market maker -> reversion -> take liquidity from underlying symbols 

ROSES: take levels with lower volume because indicator price will trend in that direction

    - do it on day 1 

    size <= 35

    fuck this doesn't work backtest pnl negative as fuck 


    for pairs tradeâ€“consider symbols a, b, pair with no lag 
    if a increases 5%, b decreases 5%, from t-1 to t, expect perhaps a and b will increase/decrease 0% from t-1 to t+1

    linear regress 
    predict a returns from t - 1 to t + 1 using a returns from t - 1 to t, b returns from t - 1 to t 
    predict b returns from t - 1 to t + 1 using a returns from t - 1 to t, b returns from t - 1 to t
